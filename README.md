# CustomerManagerMaven1

<h1> Calculator Manager Maven Project</h1>

This program is designed to store customer profiles for 2 cofee companies (Starbucks and Nero).

Starbuck gives a "*" foe each customer and requires an identity check.

This program was build and installed to be used by another (2. project).

In this project, I used Object-Oriented Principles such as inheritance, polimorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, composition, and interface.

I also practiced "Project Build Tool" and "Apache Maven" in Java.
